Provide a 'title', 'title_abbrev', and 'description' for this example in json format.
Title should be a title, title_abbrev should be a 1-5 word variation on the title, and description should
explain in one paragraph what the code is going. Provide the json raw, without markdown fences.

Sample result:

{ 
    "title": "Get an object by name from an Amazon S3 bucket",
    "title_abbrev": "Get an object",
    "description": "Use the AWS SDK for JavaScript to get an object from an Amazon S3 bucket. Steps are included that demonstrate how to split large downloads up into multiple parts."
}
